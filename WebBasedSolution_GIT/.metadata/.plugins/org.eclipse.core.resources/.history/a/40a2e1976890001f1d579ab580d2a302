Scenario: "Assembling Lego"
Given the position of the robot "Assembler" is "default" 
	which means 
		Given the position of the robot "Assembler" is "D"  
		When the robot "Assembler" moves to position "F" 
		Then the position of the robot "Assembler" is "r2
When the robot "Assembler" moves to position "point2" 
Then the position of the robot "Assembler" is "point2"



Scenario: "Assembling Lego2"
Given the position of the robot "Assembler" is "D"  
When the robot "Assembler" moves to position "F" 
Then the position of the robot "Assembler" is "r2"
